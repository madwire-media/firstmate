This is where the meat of your helm chart goes. The `_helpers.tpl`
file sets up a few variables to help you inside your YAML files.
The rest of the files here translate to Kubernetes objects to be
created in a cluster when this chart is deployed. For example, a
Deployment will define how to replicate and create instances of an
application.
