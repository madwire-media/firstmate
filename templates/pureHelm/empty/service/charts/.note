If you want to include other preexisting charts as dependencies,
you can download them into this directory for now. In the future
you could also add them to a `requirements.yaml` file in the root
directory of this chart. You can configure the values of your
dependencies by using the name of the chart. For example, if you
download the `mysql` chart with a `password` variable, you can use
`mysql.password` to set that from this chart.
